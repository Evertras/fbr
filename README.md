# Fantasy Battle Royale

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Evertras/fbr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Evertras/fbr)

Playing with Go and WebAssembly using Ebiten to create a simple 2D battle royale game.

Uses [Ebiten](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten) to compile to WebAssembly.

## Development requirements

Requires the following:

* Go 1.11
* GCC (MinGW is fine for Windows)

Run `make` to build after cloning.  The initial build or test may take some time due to OpenGL being compiled.
